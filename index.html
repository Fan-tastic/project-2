        <p>Baby, instant soup doesn't really grab me
        Today I need something more sub-sub-sub-substantial
        A can of beans or black-eyed peas, some Nescafe and ice
        A candy bar, a falling star, or a reading from Doctor Seuss
        </p>
        <p>Blue eyed devil. Born to be a God among Salesmen. Working the skinny tie. Slugging down fruit juice. Extra tall extra wide. 33 degrees. Six hundred and sixty six. Dig digging it, come on. Moving door to door to door. Stoned motel room. Nice cool on the bathroom floor.
        </p>
        <p>You shout it out, but I can't hear a word you say. I'm talking loud not saying much. I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet. You shoot me down, but I get up. I'm bulletproof nothing to lose. Fire away, fire away. Ricochet, you take your aim. Fire away, fire away. You shoot me down but I won't fall, I am titanium.
